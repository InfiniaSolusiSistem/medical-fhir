# Medical FHIR

Medical FHIR provides a Free and Open Source solution for storing and processing
 medical records in Odoo.

Many of the workflows were built in alignment with existing Odoo processes to allow for
seamless operation with other record types.

This project is oriented towards organization and data models inspired by [HL7
FHIR v3](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html).
